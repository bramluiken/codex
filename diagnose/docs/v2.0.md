# Diagnose 2.0 Documentation

Diagnose 2.0 expands the survey system with sequential questions, built‑in scoring and a simplified database setup.

## Key Features

- **Sequential Question Flow** – Each new question is fetched only after the previous answer is stored so the survey adapts in real time.
- **Dynamic Scoring** – Answers are weighted using the `weights` table to compute diagnosis scores through `/api/<id>/scores`.
- **MySQL or SQLite** – The server first tries to connect to MySQL but falls back to an in‑memory SQLite database when MySQL is unavailable.
- **Setup Script** – `sql/setup.sql` loads all tables and seed data in one command.

## Usage

1. From the `diagnose` directory start the server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t public public/index.php
   ```
2. Visit `/` to create a questionnaire link or open `/survey/<id>` directly.
3. Submit answers and retrieve scores using the `/api/<id>/scores` endpoint.

See `README.md` for database configuration and additional endpoints.
